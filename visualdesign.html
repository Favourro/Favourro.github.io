	<p> The assignment was a free draw. I decided to draw a girl and a female anatomy because that was what I knew how to draw during that time period. </p>

	<p> The teacher assigned the students to make a vision board about different achievements or experiences we want in the future. My vision board consists of drawing because I wanted to be an artist and draw more realistic drawings. I added a performance because I was on a step team and we would go to competitions where we performed on stage for judges/people. I also like to travel, I want to build a show collection in the near future, and I want to go to a fashion show. </p>

	<p> Assigned an assignment to draw a famous artist we listened to. Sza was one of the artist I listened to on a daily basis, and I really liked her facial features so I decided to draw her. </p>

	<p> Being in the Christmas spirit, making a snow man with snow, a sock, or a drawing was assigned. I didn't have any materials and being a better artist was my goal. I took it upon myself to draw instead of making a snow man from a sock because I started to get in-touch with my artistry side. </p>
