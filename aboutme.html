	<h2> 
	Introduction </h2>
<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp My name is Favour, I am Nigerian. I came to the United States in 2017. I'm a a senior in high school  I play sports like volleyball, run track, and I would like to play tennis later in the future. I'm interested in becoming a software engineer but I would major in computer science for college. I really want to go away for college to be independent but only if I get a full ride scholarship. If I don't, then I will stay in state and commute to school. My favorite color is navy blue and black.

<h2> My Passion </h2>
	<p> 
	I am a athlectic person, so whenever I played or tried a sport, I put my all into learning and playing / doing good. I've been playing volleyball for 5 years , and each year, U sink one level deeper into the sport. I get better, I decicate my time into perfecting my skills in volleyball. I want to play volleyball in college while pursuing a computer science degree. I also want to be a software engineer so that I can have a stable income that would provide me with a lifestyle that is stressfree. </p>
