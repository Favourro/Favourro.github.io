	<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp My name is Favour, I'm a a senior in high school and I play sports like volleyball, run track, and I would like to play tennis later in the future. I also draw on my free time and although people say I'm an artist, I don't consider myself an artist. I'm interested in becoming a software engineer but I would major in computer science for college. I really want to go away for college to be independent but only if I get a full ride scholarship. If I don't, then I will stay in state and commute to school. My favorite color is navy blue and black.
