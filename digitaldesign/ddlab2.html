<h1><em> Edo State: </h1></em>

<p class= "origin"><em> Edo State is a diverse state that is predominantly inhabited by the Edoid peoples, including the Edo (or Bini), Esan, Owan and Afemai peoples. The most common Edoid language spoken is the Edo language, which is commonly spoken in Benin City. First introduced to the region by Portuguese missionaries during the 15th century, Christianity is the dominant religion in Edo State with also a sizable number of Muslims though traditional religions are also practised. </p></em>

<h2><em> The People- </h2></em>

<p> With Benin City as capital, the population of the entire state is approximately 8 million. It is made up of four major ethnic groups; namely Edo (Binis), Owan, Esan and Afemai (Etsako & Akoko Edo). However the State has a high presence of residents from across the country and the world because of its cosmopolitan tendencies. Benin City has a history of being one of the foremost destinations of Europeans during their exploration of Africa continent many centuries ago. Some of these flash points have remained enviable tourists’ attraction for the state.

<h3><em> History: </h3></em>

<p> The Mid-Western Region was a division of Nigeria from 1963 to 1991, formally known as Bendel state from 1976. It was formed in June 1963 from Benin and Delta provinces of the Western Region, and its capital was Benin City. It was renamed a province in 1966, and in 1967 when the other provinces were split up into several states, it remained territorially intact, becoming a state.

During the Nigerian Civil War, the Biafran forces invaded the new Mid-Western state, en route to Lagos, in an attempt to force a quick end to the war. While under Biafran occupation, the state was declared as the “Republic of Benin” as Nigerian forces were to retake the region. The republic collapsed a day after the declaration as Nigerian troops overtook Benin City. Edo State was established on 27 August 1991 when Bendel State was split into Edo and Delta States.
